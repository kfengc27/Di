<p>Due to the recent economic downturn, your organisation is in financial distress and decides to cut wage costs by 100 Liras. The wage cut will be shared among you and your group member, based on how many sliders you each correctly solved:</p>
<p>
    The number of sliders you correctly solved in period 2 and 3: ___a___</p>
<p>The number of sliders your group member correctly solved in period 2 and 3: ___b___</p>
<p>Your percentage of contribution in period 2 and 3: ___a/(a+b)___</p>
<p>Your group member’s percentage of contribution in period 2 and 3: ___b/(a+b)___</p>
<p>Your share of the wage cut: ___[1-a/(a+b)] x 100___</p>
<p>Your group member’s share of the wage cut: ___[1-b/(a+b)] x 100___</p>
<p>Your new wage in Period 4: ___250 - [1-a/(a+b)] x 100___</p>
<p>Your group member’s new wage in Period 4: ___250 - [1-b/(a+b)] x 100___</p>

<p>If the economic condition improves and the organisation performs well, your wage in Period 5 may revert back to the original level of 250 Liras. However, given the uncertainty involved, your organisation cannot provide you with a specific target or goal. Instead, you are strongly encouraged to work as hard as possible, i.e., to correctly solve as many sliders as possible.</p>
