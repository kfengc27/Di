<h5>Welcome!</h5>

<p>Thank you for participating in this study.</p>

<p>The production task for today's study is known as an "arithmetic and slider task." Your task is to first solve an arithmetic problem and then adjust the position of the slider to the corresponding number of your answer to the arithmetic question. The question will consist of adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing numbers, and the possible answer of the question and resulting correct position of the slider can range from 0 to 100. You may adjust the position of each slider as many times as you wish.</p>

<p>You will work on the task for 5 minutes and we would like you to correctly adjust as many sliders as possible.</p>
